1. Implement A* search in astar.scm
2. Design a heuristic for jumping problem in heuristic.scm
3. A short program driver.scm that demonstrates the heuristic applied to
several meaningful states and the A* search algorithm applied to some
problems that do not take long to run.
4. A single PDF astar-heuristic.pdf containing the  heuristic design and
admissibility statements, formatted empirical results
