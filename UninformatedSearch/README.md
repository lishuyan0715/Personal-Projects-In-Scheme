1. Implement expansions, breadth-first-search, depth-limited-search, and
iterative-deepening-search algorithm in search.scm
2. Demonstrates search algorithm implementations applied to a simple
problem in driver.scm
3. Using the data generated, answer the following ques
tions in Analyses of Efficiency and Effectiveness of Uninformed Search Algorithms.pdf:
      •How do the number of nodes expanded compare among the search a
      lgorithms? How does the relative efficiency of search algorithms vary
      with problem difficulty (if at all)?
      •How do the solution costs compare among the search algorithms?
      How does this comparison vary with problem difficulty (if at all)?
